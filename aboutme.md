Hello, my name is Sean Chen.

I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences in the field of learning. Currently, I work as a front-end developer and reside in Taichung, Taiwan. My expertise lies in C#, JavaScript, and MS SQL technology. I have hands-on experience with frameworks such as React, React Native, ASP.NET MVC, and jQuery, which I utilize to create both E-commerce websites and mobile applications.

My current focus is on expanding my skills in code development while also actively sharing my expertise with others.
